<h2>National Dog Rankings</h2>
<ol class="ranking-list">
<li><strong>#1 Salem (MY DOG):</strong> Nothing beats my dog. She is the best. No dog in history can best her. End of discussion.</li>
<img src ="/images/littlepuppy.png" alt="My Dog Salem" class="dog-imgs">
<li><strong>#2 Dogbo Dobbins (Eating Snow Dog):</strong> Hard to beat this canine and his snow addiction. Dogbo easily gets second place.</li>
<img src ="/images/dogonbench.png" alt="Dog Eating Snow" class="dog-imgs">
<li><strong>#3 Whiskers (Cat with Dog Costume):</strong> Whiskers is just an outstanding dog with high intelligence and an outstanding dog citizen. Would get 2nd if not for being lazy and her weird habit of… meowing? Good show!</li>
<img src ="/images/catincostume.png" alt="Cat in Dog Costume" class="dog-imgs">
<li><strong>#4 Lassie:</strong> An obvious #4, this wonderful canine is a cinema darling and an inspiration to all dogs around the world! What a treat!</li>
<img src ="/images/lassie.png" alt="Lassie" class="dog-imgs">
<li><strong>#5 Ty (Dog biting dog):</strong> Ty successfully took out his fellow rival, Timothy, and earned himself 10 points. Well done, Ty.</li>
