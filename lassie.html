Lassie is a fictional female Rough Collie dog and is featured in a 1938 short story by Eric Knight that was later expanded to a 1940
full-length novel, <em>Lassie Come-Home</em>. Knight's portrayal of Lassie bears some features in common with another fictional female collie
of the same name featured in Elizabeth Gaskell's 1859 short story "The Half Brothers." In that story, Lassie guides adults back to where two boys
are lost in a snowstorm.

Knight's novel was filmed by MGM in 1943 as <em>Lassie Come Home</em>, with a dog named Pal playing Lassie. Pal then appeared with the stage name
"Lassie" in six other MGM films. His owner later acquired the Lassie trademark and appeared with the dog at events across America. The 1954 television
series featured Pal's descendants for 19 years, and the character continues to appear in many types of media.
